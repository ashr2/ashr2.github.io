            My name is Ash Rajesh and I'm currently a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. <br>
            I'm very interested in any opportunities to use and improve my coding skills.<br>
            I'm especially interested in the area of machine learning and how we can use deep learning to better understand mental health issues in our communities. <br>
